    <h3>About me</h3>
    <span>Hello, I am a front-end developer from the cozy town of Gifhorn, Germany. I have always been passionate about technical innovations and interested in the world of development. So now I am eagerly looking forward to translating this enthusiasm into crafting intuitive and visually engaging front-end solutions. Join me in shaping the digital landscape!</span>
    <span>Over a year ago, I decided to dive into the world of development and make a professional change in that direction. The Developer Academy greatly assisted me with its highly practical training program.</span>
    <span>In my previous job as a machine and plant operator, problem-solving was a significant and essential aspect of my work, which I found most enjoyable. Since this skill is crucial in programming, I am very excited to immerse myself in it. Therefore, please give me the chance to prove myself.</span>
